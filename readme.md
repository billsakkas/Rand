# Rand

## What is Rand?
Rand is a simple **iOS** application that calculates an ***20*** digit *random* number.
  It is completely build in Swift so it is lightweight, and it *features* a **START** and a **STOP** button that until now work flawlessly.

## CPU USAGE

![CPU USAGE](https://miltoskat.github.io/Rand/Images/cpuUsage.png)
While it is running it computes 20 independent random numbers refreshing with an independent Double time interval between 0 and 1 second. That means 20 numbers with 20 different time intervals changing after every refresh.
Apparently that takes some processing power to accomplish.
